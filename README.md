Catalog Description
Data Mining involves the search for patterns in large quantities of data. The fundamental techniques used in data mining include, but are not limited to, clustering, decision trees, neural networks, and association analysis.

Prerequisite: Minimum grade of "C-" in INFS 346 or COMP 353

Course Overview
The goal of the course is to introduce students to the current theories, practices, tools and techniques in data mining.  Because many topics and concepts in data mining are learned most efficiently through hands-on work with data sets, we will spend time with software analyzing and mining data.  The goal is to gain a better understanding of how data mining is applied and what is involved in data mining projects.  We will also explore the concept of big data and how it can be used for creating competitive edge or business opportunities. 

Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
At the end of the course students will be able to:
Understand the basic process and mechanics of data mining.
Be able to make strategic recommendations based on data mining results.
Execute basic data mining techniques using R/SQL and interpret the results.
